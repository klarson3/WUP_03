```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
require(knitr)
davisdata <- read.csv(file="UCDavis.csv")
```
## Our Goal is to answer this question Is there a difference between the alcohol consumed between the row
## you choose to sit in??

## Now with ggplot - first select the basic data

```{r}
basicCN <- ggplot(davisdata,aes(y=alcohol,x=Seat))
```
## Now add in boxplot



```{r}
basicCN + geom_boxplot()
```
The boxplot shows that it does make a difference where you sit as to how much alcohol will likely be consumed.  
  
### get fancy  

```{r}
basicCN + geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE,outlier.color = "red") + stat_boxplot(geom ='errorbar') + labs(title="Fancy notch boxplot \n with 2 lines")
```

The information in the fancy boxplot shows pretty much the same information as in the simple boxplot.

## Numerical Summarys 
```{r}
favstats(alcohol~Seat,data=ucdavis1)
```
The people sitting in the back drink more alcohol than the people in the front or the middle.

## Inferential Tests

```{r}
model1 <- aov(alcohol~Seat,data=davisdata)
summary.aov(model1)
```
p=0.000116  
The probability of the outcome is less than .o5, there is a significant difference.  


```{r}
plot(TukeyHSD(model1))
```

## Conclusions
The consumption of alcohol between sections is statistically significant.
